## **Control Statements – Easy Summary**

Programming is about writing **logic** to solve problems.
This logic is made using **control statements**.

### **Three basic ideas**

1. **Sequence** – code runs step by step
2. **Selection** – choosing what to do (`if`, `else`)
3. **Iteration** – repeating code (loops)

---

### **Boolean Expressions**

* Give only **True** or **False**
* Use comparison operators like `>`, `<`, `==`, `!=`
* Used to make decisions and loops

---

### **If / Else Statements**

* `if` runs code **only when condition is True**
* `else` runs when condition is **False**
* `elif` is used to check **more conditions**

---

### **Logical Operators**

* `and` → both conditions must be True
* `or` → one condition must be True
* `not` → reverses True/False
* Use brackets `()` to make logic clear

---

### **Membership Testing**

* `in` / `not in` checks if a value exists in a list or string

---

### **Ternary Operator**

* Short form of `if...else`
* Returns **one of two values**
* Example:

  ```python
  highest = a if a > b else b
  ```

---

### **Loops (Iteration)**

* **while loop** → repeats while condition is True
* **for loop** → repeats over a list or range of numbers
* `range()` is used to count numbers

---

### **Loop Control**

* `break` → stop the loop
* `continue` → skip to next loop
* `else` in loop runs only if loop ends normally

---

### **Nested Control Statements**

* Control statements inside another control statement
* Too much nesting makes code hard to read

---

### **Final Point**

* Programs use **if**, **loops**, and **logic** to make decisions
* These help computers think step by step like humans

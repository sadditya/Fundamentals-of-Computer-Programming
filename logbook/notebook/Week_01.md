## Introduction to Programming – Simple Summary

* A **computer program** is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do.
* Programs **take input**, **process it**, and **produce output**.
* Programmers write programs using **programming languages** to solve problems.

### Programming Languages

* **1GL (Machine Code):** Numbers only, very hard to write and understand.
* **2GL (Assembly):** Uses short words (mnemonics), still difficult and CPU-dependent.
* **3GL (High-level languages):** Easy for humans to read and write (e.g. **Python, C, Java**).
* **4GL:** Very high-level and domain-specific (e.g. **SQL, R**).

### Why Python?

* Python is **easy to learn** and **widely used**.
* Supports **procedural, object-oriented, and functional** programming.
* Used in **data science, AI, security, and web development**.
* Great language for **beginners**.

### Python Tools

* **Python Interpreter:** Runs code line-by-line (interactive mode / REPL).
* **IDEs:** Full software tools with editor, debugger, etc. (used for big programs).

### Expressions in Python

* Expressions combine **operators and values**, e.g. `10 + 5`.
* Python follows **operator precedence** (e.g. multiplication before addition).

### Common Operators

* `+` addition
* `-` subtraction
* `*` multiplication
* `/` division
* `**` power
* `//` floor division
* `%` remainder

### Errors in Programming

* **Syntax errors:** Mistakes in writing code (easy to fix).
* **Logical errors (bugs):** Code runs but gives wrong result (harder to find).
* Always **read error messages carefully**.

### Key Takeaways

* Programming is about **problem solving**.
* Python is a **beginner-friendly 3GL**.
* Practice using the interpreter helps learning.
* **Errors are normal** – fixing them is part of programming.
